## Design and implementation

The project uses the [CAPSENSE&trade; middleware](https://github.com/Infineon/capsense) (see ModusToolbox&trade; user guide for more details on selecting the middleware). See [AN85951 – PSOC&trade; 4 and PSOC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951) for more details on CAPSENSE&trade; features and usage.

The design has a CSD-based, three buttons, CAPSENSE&trade; slider, and EZI2C peripheral. The EZI2C slave peripheral is used to monitor the sensor data of buttons, slider and slider touch position information on a PC using the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner available in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; via I2C communication. When the CAPSENSE&trade; linear slider is touched, depending on the touch position, the corresponding LEDs are turned ON. In the case of CAPSENSE&trade; buttons, if a touch is detected, corresponding LEDs are turned ON as shown in **Table 1**.

**Table 1. LEDs state depending on the CAPSENSE&trade; button/slider touch**

 Sensor             | CY8CKIT-149   | CY8CKIT-145-40XX  | CY8CKIT-045S
 :-------           | :------------ | :-----------      | :----------

 LINEARSLIDER0_SNS4 | LED9          | LED8              | RGB_BLUE
 LINEARSLIDER0_SNS5 | LED10         | -                 | -
<br>

The code scans the widgets using the CSD sensing method and sends the CAPSENSE&trade; raw data over an I2C interface to the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner GUI tool on a PC using the on-board KitProg USB-I2C bridge.

The following steps explain the tuning procedure. Because the project already has the necessary settings by default, you can skip this procedure and go to [Operation](#operation) to verify the operation. To understand the tuning process and follow the steps for this kit or your own board, see [Tuning procedure](#tuning-procedure).

> **Note:** For more details on SmartSense, see the "SmartSense full auto-tune" section in the [PSOC&trade; 4 and PSOC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951).


### Tuning procedure

SmartSense is a CAPSENSE&trade; tuning method that automatically sets sensing parameters for optimal performance based on user-specified Finger capacitance (pF) values and continuously compensates for system, manufacturing, and environmental changes.
In SmartSense Full Auto-tune mode, the only parameter that needs to be tuned by the user is the Finger capacitance (pF) parameter. The Finger capacitance (pF) parameter indicates the minimum value of Finger capacitance (pF) that should be detected as a valid touch by the CAPSENSE&trade; widget.

> **Note:** Even for the SmartSense auto-tuning, the CAPSENSE&trade; allows manual configuration of some general parameters like enabling and disabling of compensation IDAC, filters, shield such as liquid-tolerance related parameters and modulator clock. These can be left at their default values for most cases or configured based on the requirements.


####  Tuning button widgets

**Figure 5. CSD button widgets tuning flow**

![](images/button-tuning-flow-chart.png)

Do the following to tune the slider:

<details><summary><b>Stage 1: Select the highest Finger capacitance (pF) value</b></summary>

1. Connect to CAPSENSE&trade; tuner by following the steps in the [Testing the basic operation](#testing-the-basic-operation) section.

2. Select the **Button0**, **Button1**, and **Button2** checkboxes and select **Synchronized** under **Read mode** and then navigate to **Graph View** as shown in **Figure 6**.

   The **Graph View** shows the raw counts and baseline for **Button0**, **Button1**, and **Button2** in the **Sensor data** window. Ensure that the **Raw counts** and **Baseline** checkboxes are selected to view the sensor data.

   **Figure 6. CAPSENSE&trade; tuner graph view**

   ![](images/button_graph_view.png)

3. In the **Widget hardware parameters** section, select **Finger capacitance (pF)** value as '1' (highest Finger capacitance (pF)) and click on **Apply to device** symbol to apply the changes to the device as shown in **Figure 7**.

   **Figure 7. CAPSENSE&trade; Widget hardware parameters**

   ![](images/button_max_finger_capacitance.png)

   > **Note:** The valid range of **Finger capacitance (pF)** is 0.1 to 1.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Stage 2: Coarse tuning</b></summary>

1. Measure the signal and calculate the SNR.

   1. Switch to the **SNR Measurement** tab for measuring the SNR and to verify that the SNR is above 5:1, select **Button0** and **Button0_Sns0** sensor, and then click **Acquire Noise** as shown in **Figure 8**.

      **Figure 8. CAPSENSE&trade; tuner - SNR measurement: acquire noise**

      ![](images/button_acquire_noise_signal.png)

   2. Once the noise is acquired, place the finger at a position on the button and then click **Acquire Signal**. Ensure that the finger remains on the button as long as the signal acquisition is in progress. Observe that the SNR is above 5:1.

      The calculated SNR on this button is displayed, as shown in **Figure 9**. Based on your end system design, test the signal with a finger that matches the size of your normal use case. Typically, the finger size targets are ~ 8 to 9 mm. Consider testing with smaller sizes that should be rejected by the system to ensure that they do not reach the finger threshold.

      **Figure 9. CAPSENSE&trade; tuner - SNR measurement: acquire signal**

      ![](images/button_acquire_signal.png)

2. Is SNR > 5:1 and does sensor status change to '1' on touch?

     1. Switch to the **Graph View** tab to verify the status change. Place the finger at a position on the button and see the status graph.

        Observe there is no change in the status signal for Finger capacitance (pF) value '1' as shown in **Figure 10**.

        **Figure 10. CAPSENSE&trade; tuner - status signal**

        ![](images/button_status_signal.png)

     2. For Finger capacitance (pF) value '1', SNR > 5:1 but the status signal is '0' on touch.

3. Choose the next lower value of Finger capacitance (pF).

    1. If the Finger capacitance (pF) value does not satisfy the both conditions (SNR > 5:1 & sensor status change to '1' on touch), choose the next lower value of Finger capacitance (pF).

    2. Repeat step 1 and step 2 in coarse-tuning process and verify both the conditions.

    3. Repeat step 3 until both conditions are satisfied.

       For this case, both conditions are satisfied for the Finger capacitance (pF) value 0.50, as shown in **Figure 11** and **Figure 12**.

        **Figure 11. CAPSENSE&trade; tuner - Status signal**

        ![](images/button_status_signal_1.png)

       **Figure 12. CAPSENSE&trade; tuner - SNR measurement**

        ![](images/button_snr_measurement.png)

    > **Note:** Coarse-tuning satisfies the requirements of most designs, but fine-tuning allows you to choose the most efficient CAPSENSE&trade; parameters (i.e., minimum sensor scan time) using the SmartSense.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Stage 3: Fine tuning</b></summary>

1. Choose the next higher value of Finger capacitance (pF).

   The next higher value of Finger capacitance (pF) is '0.60'. Change the Finger capacitance (pF) value to 0.50 to 0.60 and click on **Apply to device**, as shown in **Figure 9**.

      **Figure 9. CAPSENSE&trade; Apply to device button**

      ![](images/apply-to-device.png)

2. Measure the signal and calculate the SNR.

   1. Follow the same procedure explained in coarse-tuning step 1 to measure the SNR.

3. If the SNR > 5:1 and does the sensor status change to '1' on touch?

   1. Follow the same procedure explained in coarse tuning step 2 and verify the conditions.

4. Choose the Finger capacitance (pF) value.

   1. If the Finger capacitance (pF) value does not satisfy the conditions in step 3, skip to step 5.

   2. If the Finger capacitance (pF) value satisfy the conditions in step 3, choose that Finger capacitance (pF) value.

5. Decrease the Finger capacitance (pF) to a value in between the current and the next lower available value.

   The next lowest value between 0.60 and 0.50 is '0.59'. Change the Finger capacitance (pF) value to 0.59 and click on **Apply to device** button as shown in **Figure 9**.

6. Repeat the step 2, step 3, and step 4 for optimal Finger capacitance (pF) value.

   After following the steps the optimal value of Finger capacitance (pF) for **Button0** is '0.53'.

Repeat the entire tuning process for **Button1** and **Button2**.

> **Note:** For [CY8CKIT-045S](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-045S), only one button (Button0) is present.

</details>

> **Note:** The following tuning steps are done on [CY8CKIT-149](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-149). Follow the same tuning procedure for [CY8CKIT-145-40XX](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-145-40XX) and [CY8CKIT-045S](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-045S) kits.

The optimal Finger capacitance (pF) values after tuning is:

 Widget  |  [CY8CKIT-149](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-149) | [CY8CKIT-145-40XX](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-145-40XX) | [CY8CKIT-045S](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-045S)
 :------- | :------------    | :-----------  | :----------
 Button0 | 0.53 | 0.16 | 0.12
 Button1 | 0.35 | 0.79 | -
 Button2 | 0.26 | 0.57 | -

</details>

<details><summary><b>Stage 2: Slide finger over the slider and monitor the difference count i.e., Sensor Signal</b></summary>

   Observe the **Sensor Signal** in **Graph View** section (see **Figure 16**) while sliding the finger. There is no change in the Sensor Signal for Finger capacitance (pF) value '1'.

   **Figure 16. CAPSENSE&trade; Sensor Signal**

   ![](images/slider_sensor_signal.png)

</details>

<details><summary><b>Stage 3: At any finger position, do at least two slider segments provide difference count (Sensor Signal > 0)?</b></summary>

At any finger position, if at least two slider segments provides Sensor Signal > 0 , **Skip** to stage 4. If not, continue the process.

1. Is Finger capacitance (pF) >= minimum allowed Finger capacitance (pF) value?

   The minimum allowed Finger capacitance (pF) value is '0.1'. Check the given Finger capacitance (pF) value is >= 0.1.

   If the value is less than 0.1, **End the tuning process**.

   A hardware change may be required. Review slider design* or use manual tuning**.

   If the value is not less than 0.1, continue the process.


2. Decrease Finger capacitance (pF) value by one unit.

   1. Decrease the **Finger capacitance (pF)** value by one unit in **Widget hardware parameters** section and click on **Apply to device** symbol to apply the changes to the device as shown in **Figure 17**.

      **Figure 17. CAPSENSE&trade; Graph view**

      ![](images/slider_finger_capacitance_1.png)

   2. Repeat the process from **Stage 2**.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Stage 4: At any finger position, at least one slider segment provides an SNR > 5:1 and sensor signal > 50?</b></summary>

1. Measure the signal, calculate the SNR and verify SNR > 5:1.

3. Repeat step 1 and step 2 for LinearSlider0_Sns1, LinearSlider0_Sns2, LinearSlider0_Sns3, LinearSlider0_Sns4 and LinearSlider0_Sns5.

   > **Note:** For [CY8CKIT-145-40XX](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-145-40XX) and [CY8CKIT-045S](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-045S) kits, only five slider segments present (LinearSlider0_Sns0, LinearSlider0_Sns1, LinearSlider0_Sns2, LinearSlider0_Sns3, and LinearSlider0_Sns4).

4. If at any finger position, at least one slider segment provides an SNR > 5:1 and sensor signal > 50 choose that Finger capacitance (pF).

   By following the above process at Finger capacitance (pF) value is 0.2, satisfies both the conditions as shown in the **Figure 21** and **Figure 22**

####  Breathing effect of LED

In this code example, an user LED (LED1) is used to demonstrate the breathing effect. As shown in **Figure 23**, the breathing effect is generated by XORing two PWM signals that have slightly different frequencies with a duty cycle of 50 percent. The XOR gate is implemented using the SmartIO Component. The SmartIO Component is configured in a combinatorial mode with the look-up table (LUT) configured for an XOR gate implementation. The two PWMs are of 100 Hz and 101.01 Hz frequency. Routing these PWM signals through an exclusive-OR (XOR) gate yields an output signal with a gradually changing duty cycle. Driving an LED with this signal results in a “breathing” effect, where the LED gradually gets brighter or dimmer. The rate of change is proportional to the difference between the PWM output frequencies.

This breathing LED part of the code example is performed entirely in hardware. Firmware is not required to do anything for the breathing effect to work.

   > **Note:** This breathing effect is implemented only for the CY8CKIT-149 and CY8CKIT-145-40XX kits, as the CY8CKIT-045S has only a single RGB LED.
